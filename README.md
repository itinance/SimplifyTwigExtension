SimplifyTwigExtension
=====================

Brings ezComponents str_simplify-function to Twig

Substitutes newlines, tabs, and multiple spaces from the string $str and replaces it with a single blank. 
Whitespace in the beginning and at the end of the $str are removed

Stolen from the former ezComponents-Framework
